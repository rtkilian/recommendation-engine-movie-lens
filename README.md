# Building Recommendation Engines Using the MovieLens Dataset
In this repository, I experiment with different techniques to predict a user's review of movies based on the MovieLens dataset.

## Contents

### Techniques
* [Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Engine](../master/Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_System.ipynb): building a system that predicts a user's score of a movie based on the collaborative filtering via matrix factorisation
* [Content Based Recommendation Engine](../master/content_based_recommendation_engine.ipynb): building a system that predicts a user's score of a movie based on the movie description, title, cast, director, etc.
* [Retrieval Engine using TensorFlow](../master/Recommending_Movies_Retrieval.ipynb): building a retrieval engine using TensorFlow that takes a user as an input, as outputs the top-k movies for further ranking.
